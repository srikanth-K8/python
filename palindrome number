            x //= 10  # Remove the last digit from x

        # If the number has even digits, x will be equal to reversed_half
        # If the number has odd digits, reversed_half will have the middle digit in the ones place, so we can discard it by reversed_half // 10
        return x == reversed_half or x == reversed_half // 10
